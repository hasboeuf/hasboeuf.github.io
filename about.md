I'm Adrien Gavignet (aka hasboeuf), I'm an R&D software engineer working at [@Genymobile](https://twitter.com/Genymobile)
in the [@Genymotion](https://twitter.com/Genymotion) team. I'm currently living in _Lyon, France_.

If you are a Genymotion user, I would be happy to hear about your use cases or any feature request.

I'm a passionate dev and maker, I guess all began with LEGO during my childhood...
I love mountains, B&W photography and cheese, thankfully I'm coming from _Franche-Comt√©_ area, which is the cheese provider of France (no doubt), I can surely get you some prices.

_Tired of the office? Go to the mountains._

This blog is about sharing some dev and random things.

All views expressed are my own, entities you should not blame:
* My family
* My friends
* My employer

Instead you should blame:
* Me
* Possibly people that are making pinapple pizza

See you!

Adrien
