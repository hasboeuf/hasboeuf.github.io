So after having tried several Jekyll themes, I decided to use [Centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

Reasons of this choice are:
- The layout is kind of the one I wanted for this blog (no sidebar menu then it's mobile friendly, posts simply listed, navigation links in the header, well-furnished footer)
- Great social network integration
- Pagination
- Site map
- Disqus integration
- Easy customization (it tooks me few minutes to fine tune CSS to setup my black and white look and feel)
- Code is pretty clear and documented (think about favicon generation, url patterns, etc)
- Main page header image (was not a criteria for me but then I can show you a nice pic of the _Queyras Regional Park, France_, so I'm happy with it)

I also looked around open issues and applied some relevant patches suggested by the community ;)

Note that I'm not a front end dev so the code is probably messy and would require some cleanup but it's fair enough to me for a personal blog.

A big thank to the author Ben Centra.
